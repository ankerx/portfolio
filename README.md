## Description

Finally I have created my own portfolio website. I used NextJS to use a lot of benefits it provides. Data is fetched by GraphQL from headless CMS (graphCMS) so I can easily add new content.
Fully responsive website with light and dark theme, smooth animations created with framer motion.
